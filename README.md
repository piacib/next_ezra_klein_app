# The Ezra Klein Podject

Welcome to the Ezra Klein Podject! This is my in progress projects that seeks to get all book recommendations made by guests appearing on the Ezra Klein show and
displaying them along with reviews and ratings from the google books.

## How to navigate this project

- [accesible table with interesting mobile display](https://github.com/piacib/next_ezra_klein_app/blob/main/src/components/Table/Table.tsx)

# Why I built the project this way

- I chose to use nextjs to learn a new and commonly used technology. Having build all my previous applications as purely frontend projects I wanted to explore a full stack project and learn how to utilize Server Side Rendering.

- I use react-testing-library and jest to future proof my frontend and ensure maintainability

## In the future

- Currently, it is using a static dataset to display book data and I will be adding an auto check for new episodes and get the book data from guest recommendations.

- I plan to use cypress to imporove and expand on my testing
